Hydrator (will be) an [Electron] based desktop application to hydrate a Twitter
ID dataset.  This is (obviously) a work in progress. If you are interested in
learning more please join us in [Slack].

Install:

    npm install

Start a hot-swappable development server:

    npm run dev

Or package it all up as a desktop app:

    npm run package 

Hydrator was created using [electron-react-boilerplate] so check out that 
documentation for more information about commands that are available.
